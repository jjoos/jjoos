First post
Why another blog?

TL;DR
Because I want to:
Contribute
Educate
Organize my research.
Get external opinions (and learn from them).

Contribute
I lurk a lot in the tech community. But I'm not really participating. I want to change this and give something back to the community.

Educate
I want to teach people the things I'm learning myself. I really liked presenting on technical topics for my colleagues (at my former job). So why not do this digitally.

Research
A lot of my time I'm reading twitter, blogs and papers. I have too many interests, so I can't read everything. A read it later service doesn't really work for me, so I devised an other pattern. I enrich markdown documents on certain topics with links, so when the time is right and I want to read up on a certain topic I can open that document and read everything I have acumelated.

External opinions
I added Disqus [http://disqus.com/] to my blog so people can give there opinion about my articles.
I have a lot of ideas about everything, but too little people giving their opion to me. It's maybe the best way to learn things.

Conclusion
So this is my blog, I'll try to regularly post on it.
